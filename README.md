Creating a comprehensive codebase for an AI-enhanced vehicle safety system involves multiple components, including data acquisition from sensors, machine learning for risk assessment, and a user interface for alerts. Below is a simplified example that outlines how you might structure such a system using Python for the backend, along with some pseudo-code for the frontend. This example will focus on the core functionalities of risk assessment and collision avoidance.

1. Environment Setup
Before you start coding, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use pip to install them:

pip install numpy pandas opencv-python tensorflow flask

2. Data Acquisition (Sensor Simulation)
For this example, we'll simulate sensor data. In a real-world application, you would replace this with actual sensor data from cameras and LiDAR.

import numpy as np

def get_sensor_data():
    # Simulate sensor data: [distance_to_obstacle, speed_of_vehicle]
    distance_to_obstacle = np.random.uniform(0, 50)  # Distance in meters
    speed_of_vehicle = np.random.uniform(0, 100)  # Speed in km/h
    return distance_to_obstacle, speed_of_vehicle

3. Risk Assessment Model
Hereâ€™s a simple machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict risk based on sensor data.

import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample dataset creation (for demonstration purposes)
def create_dataset():
    # Generate synthetic data: [distance_to_obstacle, speed_of_vehicle] -> [risk_level]
    X = np.random.rand(1000, 2) * np.array([[50], [100]])  # Random distances and speeds
    y = (X[:, 0] < 10).astype(int)  # Risk level: 1 if distance < 10m else 0
    return train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Build a simple neural network model
def build_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Train the model
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = create_dataset()
model = build_model()
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

4. Collision Avoidance Logic
This function checks the risk level and executes collision avoidance actions.

def assess_risk_and_avoid_collision(distance_to_obstacle, speed_of_vehicle):
    input_data = np.array([[distance_to_obstacle, speed_of_vehicle]])
    risk_level = model.predict(input_data)[0][0]

    if risk_level > 0.5:  # If risk is high
        print("Warning: Collision imminent! Taking evasive action.")
        # Implement collision avoidance logic (e.g., brake or steer)
        return "Collision Avoidance Activated"
    else:
        print("All clear. Continue driving.")
        return "No Action Needed"

5. User Interface (Flask Web Application)
A simple Flask application to display alerts to the user.

from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/check_safety', methods=['GET'])
def check_safety():
    distance_to_obstacle, speed_of_vehicle = get_sensor_data()
    action = assess_risk_and_avoid_collision(distance_to_obstacle, speed_of_vehicle)
    
    return jsonify({
        'distance_to_obstacle': distance_to_obstacle,
        'speed_of_vehicle': speed_of_vehicle,
        'action': action
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
